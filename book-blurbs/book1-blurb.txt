What if belief is the one thing standing between you and reality?

You were taught that believing is noble. That certainty is strength. That conviction signals character.

None of it is true.

The Anatomy of Belief dismantles the mechanism of belief itself -- not what you believe, but why you believe at all, and what it costs you every single day. You'll discover why the strength of your conviction has zero bearing on truth. Why identity fuses with belief to create invisible prisons. And why the addiction to being right is the most expensive habit you've never questioned.

This is not a book about replacing old beliefs with better ones.

This is a book about what becomes possible when you stop believing altogether -- and start seeing.

Book 1 in the Reality Without Belief series.
