Let me start with this. Belief is not required for reality to function. Disbelief isn’t either. Reality does not care what we think about it. It does not wait for approval. It does not bend to preference. It simply is what it is.

I do not live by belief. I do not live by disbelief. I live by knowledge, evidence, and what can be verified. And I live aligned with what Werner Erhard called “What’s So.”

Most people spend their lives arguing with reality. They argue with facts. They argue with outcomes. They argue with consequences. They tell themselves stories about how things should have gone instead of dealing with how they actually went.

What’s so is the end of that argument. It says this is what happened. This is what exists. This is where you are. From here, what are you going to do?

Belief often becomes a substitute for evidence. Disbelief becomes a substitute in the opposite direction. Both avoid the discipline of verification.

I don’t need certainty to live. I need accuracy. I need clarity.

If something can be demonstrated, I take it seriously. If it can’t, I leave it alone. I don’t oppose it. I don’t defend against it. I simply don’t build my life on it.

This removes noise. It removes unnecessary conflict. It removes the pressure to be right.

Living in alignment with what’s so does not mean surrender. It means effectiveness. You can’t take meaningful action until you know where you actually are.

Beliefs collapse under evidence. Disbelief collapses too. Reality remains.

I don’t need a story to live honestly. I don’t need metaphysics to take responsibility. I don’t need belief to face what’s in front of me.

So this is my position. Knowledge over belief. Evidence over assertion. Reality over narrative. What’s so over what I wish were so.

I don’t believe in reality. I live in it. And that’s enough.
