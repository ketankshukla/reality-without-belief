# Chapter 46: Living Without Explanation

There is a deep human craving for explanation. When something happens, we want to know why. When we act, we want to be able to say what moved us. When events unfold, we want the story that makes sense of them. This craving runs so deep that we often create explanations where none exist, fabricating reasons, inventing causes, constructing narratives to fill the gap where explanation should be.

Living without explanation means releasing this craving. It means accepting that things happen without always knowing why. It means acting without always having a story about what you are doing. It means encountering the world without requiring that the world explain itself to you. This is harder than it sounds because the craving for explanation is automatic and constant.

The craving for explanation is connected to the need for control. If you can explain something, you can predict it. If you can predict it, you can perhaps control it. Explanation is a form of mastery over the chaos of existence. When you cannot explain, you face the uncomfortable truth that much of what happens is beyond your understanding and therefore beyond your control. The craving for explanation is partly a defense against this uncomfortable truth.

But explanation often does not deliver what it promises. Many of the explanations we construct are false. They are stories we tell that feel right but do not correspond to the actual causes of things. We explain others' behavior based on our assumptions about their motives, which are often wrong. We explain events based on patterns that may not apply. We explain our own actions based on reasons that may not be the real reasons. The explanations provide the feeling of understanding without the reality of understanding.

When you live without explanation, you give up this false comfort. You acknowledge that you do not always know why things happen. You accept that your explanations, when you offer them, are hypotheses rather than certainties. You hold explanations lightly, as tools that may be useful but should not be mistaken for truth. This is more honest than the pretense of explanation, even though it is less comfortable.

Living without explanation does not mean abandoning inquiry. You can still ask why. You can still investigate causes. You can still seek understanding. The difference is in how you hold the results. When investigation produces an answer, you hold it provisionally. When investigation produces no answer, you do not fabricate one. You tolerate the not-knowing that honest inquiry often leaves.

There is a certain freedom in not needing to explain. When you do not require explanations, you can encounter things more directly. The event happens. You experience it. You respond to it. The additional layer of explanation, which often distorts more than it clarifies, is not required. You are in more direct contact with what is so because you are not filtering it through explanatory frameworks.

This is especially true for self-explanation. Most people carry a constant internal narrative explaining themselves to themselves. Why they did what they did. What they are feeling and why. What kind of person they are and how current behavior fits that story. This internal explanation is exhausting and often inaccurate. Living without explanation includes living without this constant self-narration. You act. You feel. You do not need to explain it to yourself.

The demand for explanation can also prevent action. When you require an explanation before acting, you may wait forever. Many actions arise from sources that cannot be articulated. Intuition, subtle perception, body wisdom, all of these can guide action without providing explanation. The person who demands explanation before action is cut off from these sources. Living without explanation means being willing to act without fully understanding why, trusting that effective action does not always come with explanatory packaging.

Others may demand explanations from you. They may ask why you did something, why you think something, why you are who you are. You can respond with what you know while acknowledging what you do not know. You can say that you do not know why, and this can be an honest and complete answer. You do not owe explanations you do not have. The social expectation that you should be able to explain yourself is just that, an expectation. It is not a reality about what you must provide.

Living without explanation is related to living without narrative. Explanation is a form of narrative. It tells a story about causes and effects, about reasons and motivations. When you release narrative, you release much of the explanatory apparatus with it. What remains is the bare fact of what happens, without the additional layer of why.

This does not make you irrational. Rationality does not require explanation of everything. Rationality is about responding appropriately to reality. Much appropriate response happens without explanation. You do not need to explain why you pull your hand from a hot stove. You do not need to explain why you feel joy at beauty. You do not need to explain why you care about the people you care about. These things are simply what is so about you, and they do not become more real or valid by being explained.

The craving for explanation can also create suffering. When something painful happens, the question why is often the first and loudest response. Why did this happen? Why to me? Why now? These questions, when they have no answers, become sources of additional suffering. You suffer from the event and you suffer from the inability to explain the event. Living without explanation means letting the second suffering go. The event happened. That is what is so. Explanation would not undo it, and the absence of explanation does not add to the event itself.

There is a simplicity to living without explanation. Much of the complexity of human mental life comes from the explanatory apparatus. The constant why, the endless search for reasons, the construction and maintenance of explanatory frameworks. When this is set aside, life becomes simpler. Events happen. You respond. There is no additional burden of understanding why, no anxiety about whether your explanations are correct, no energy spent maintaining stories about causes and meanings.

This simplicity is not simplistic. It is not about being unintelligent or incurious. It is about recognizing that explanation is often impossible, usually uncertain, and sometimes counterproductive. The simple engagement with what is so, without requiring that it explain itself, is a more mature relationship with reality than the constant demand for understanding.

Living without explanation is one expression of the broader orientation this book describes. It is living in what is so rather than in stories about what is so. It is accepting reality without requiring reality to justify itself. It is engaging with existence directly rather than through the mediating layer of explanation. This is challenging because explanation is so automatic, so habitual, so deeply ingrained. But it is possible. And the freedom it offers is real.

You can live without knowing why. You can act without being able to explain. You can experience without narrating. This is not a lesser way of living. In many ways, it is a more direct, more honest, more immediate way of living. The explanations were never as solid as they seemed. Living without them is living closer to the truth of how things actually are: often inexplicable, usually more complex than any explanation captures, always exceeding the stories we tell about them.
