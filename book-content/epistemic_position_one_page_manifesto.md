# A One-Page Epistemic Manifesto

## Core Position
I do not organize my understanding of reality around belief or disbelief. I operate on what can be known, tested, demonstrated, or reliably inferred. Anything outside that domain is irrelevant to how I think or act.

---

## First Principles

1. **Belief is not truth**
   Belief has no inherent value. It is only useful if it increases accuracy, predictive power, or decision quality.

2. **Disbelief is not superior**
   Rejecting a claim without evidence offers no advantage over accepting one without evidence.

3. **Knowledge is the only currency**
   What matters is what can be verified, reasoned, modeled, or tested.

4. **Irrelevant questions are discarded, not debated**
   A question that cannot affect understanding or action does not deserve attention.

## Evaluation Standard
A claim must do at least one of the following to be considered:
- Make testable predictions
- Improve explanatory power
- Reduce uncertainty
- Guide action measurably

If it does none of these, it is excluded.

---

## Identity-Free Thinking
- No belief is tied to identity
- No idea is defended for emotional or social reasons
- All positions are provisional and revisable

---

## Practical Result
- Low dogma
- High adaptability
- Comfort with uncertainty
- No need for metaphysical certainty

---

## Final Line

**Reality does not require belief to function. Neither do I.**
