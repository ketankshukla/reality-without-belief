## Working Title
**Reality Without Belief: An Uncompromising Rejection of Belief and Disbelief Culture**

## Core Thesis
Reality does not require belief or disbelief. Both are psychological positions that distract from what actually exists. This book rejects belief culture entirely and replaces it with disciplined alignment to what is demonstrably so.

This is not spirituality, atheism, skepticism, or faith. It is a refusal to outsource perception to ideology.

## Tone
Uncompromising. Precise. Calm. Unsympathetic to delusion, but not hostile. Zero hand-holding.
