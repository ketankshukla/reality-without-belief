I want to speak directly, plainly, and without hiding behind abstractions. This is not a performance, and it’s not an argument meant to convince anyone. It’s a statement of how I live, how I think, and how I relate to reality.

I do not organize my life around belief. I do not organize it around disbelief either. I find both unnecessary. What I organize my life around is knowledge, fact, evidence, and what can be verified or tested. And beyond that, I organize my life around what Werner Erhard calls “What’s So” — what actually is, not what I wish it were, not what I fear it might be, and not what would be more comforting or convenient to believe.

Most people are trained from an early age to think in terms of belief. Believe this. Don’t believe that. Believe harder. Question less. Or, on the other side, disbelieve this, reject that, oppose what others believe. But notice something important: belief and disbelief are still the same kind of activity. They are both positions taken toward claims. They are attitudes. They are psychological stances. Neither of them, by themselves, have anything to do with whether something is actually true.

Truth does not require belief. Reality does not wait for consensus. Facts do not improve when we like them, and they do not weaken when we dislike them. What is real remains real regardless of our inner state. That simple observation, once fully absorbed, makes belief and disbelief feel oddly irrelevant.

I am not interested in what people believe. I am interested in what can be shown. I am not interested in what feels right. I am interested in what stands up to scrutiny. I am not interested in defending ideas as identities. I am interested in understanding how things actually work.

Belief is often confused with knowledge, but they are fundamentally different. Belief is acceptance without sufficient evidence. Knowledge is a conclusion reached because evidence demands it. Belief is optional. Knowledge is binding. When gravity is operating, it does not matter what you believe about it. When a diagnosis is correct, it does not care whether you accept it emotionally. When a situation exists, it does not wait for you to agree with it before unfolding.

This is where “What’s So” becomes central. “What’s so” is not a philosophy. It is not a coping mechanism. It is not positive thinking or negative thinking. It is a ruthless honesty about the state of reality as it is, stripped of interpretation, stripped of narrative, stripped of emotional coloring.

What’s so is simply this: what is actually happening. What has already occurred. What is presently the case. What cannot be undone by preference or denial.

What’s so does not care about your intentions. It does not care about your excuses. It does not care about your hopes or your regrets. It does not care whether you feel treated fairly or unfairly. It is not cruel, and it is not kind. It just is.

Most human suffering does not come from what’s so. It comes from the resistance to what’s so. It comes from arguing with reality. From insisting that things should be different before we are willing to deal with them. From believing stories about how things ought to be instead of facing how they actually are.

When you fully accept what’s so, something surprising happens. You don’t become passive. You don’t become resigned. You become effective. Because now you are responding to reality, not fighting an imaginary version of it.

This is why belief and disbelief fall away. They are not needed. If something is demonstrably the case, I deal with it. If something is not demonstrably the case, I don’t waste energy affirming it or rejecting it. I simply leave it aside.

There is a powerful clarity that comes from saying, “I don’t know, and that’s fine.” There is strength in refusing to pretend certainty where none exists. Belief often functions as a substitute for knowledge. Disbelief often functions as a mirror-image substitute. Both can become ways of avoiding the harder discipline of evidence.

I am not against belief. I simply don’t rely on it. I am not against disbelief. I simply don’t elevate it. Neither deserves authority over how I think or act.

Instead, I ask very simple questions. What is the claim? What is the evidence? Can it be tested? Can it be independently verified? Does it make reliable predictions? Does it improve understanding or decision-making? If the answer is yes, I take it seriously. If the answer is no, I don’t argue with it. I don’t fight it. I don’t mock it. I simply don’t use it.

This applies across the board. Religion. Spirituality. Ideology. Politics. Identity. Self-concepts. Stories we tell ourselves about who we are and why things happen to us. None of these get a free pass. None of them are immune from the question: is this grounded in reality, or is it a narrative layered on top of reality?

Many people hear this and assume it’s cold or detached. It isn’t. In fact, it is the opposite. It is deeply grounding. It removes unnecessary conflict. It removes the constant internal friction of defending beliefs. When you are not invested in being right, you become far more capable of learning.

Beliefs tend to harden into identities. Once that happens, evidence becomes a threat. Disbelief can do the same thing. Once you define yourself by what you oppose, you become just as rigid. I refuse both traps.

I do not need a belief to give my life meaning. Meaning is constructed through action, responsibility, understanding, and engagement with reality. I do not need metaphysical guarantees to live with integrity. I do not need cosmic validation to tell the truth as best I can.

Living in alignment with what’s so means I deal with situations as they present themselves. Not as I wish they had presented themselves. Not as they should have presented themselves according to some internal rulebook. I take responsibility for what is in front of me now.

If something has failed, I don’t pretend it hasn’t. If something has changed, I don’t cling to the past version. If a relationship ends, a door closes, a plan collapses, I don’t spend my energy bargaining with reality. I acknowledge what’s so, and then I decide what to do next.

This is not fatalism. Fatalism says nothing can be done. What’s so says this is where we are. From here, action becomes possible. From denial, action does not.

The world does not improve because we believe comforting things about it. It improves because we accurately understand it and act accordingly. Progress has never come from belief alone. It has come from observation, experimentation, correction, and humility before evidence.

When belief conflicts with evidence, belief loses. When disbelief conflicts with evidence, disbelief loses. Evidence does not negotiate.

This approach also removes a tremendous amount of unnecessary judgment. When you see people acting irrationally, you no longer need to condemn them. You see causes, incentives, limitations, conditioning. When you see yourself making mistakes, you don’t collapse into shame. You correct course.

What’s so includes your own flaws. Your own limitations. Your own blind spots. Accepting that is not self-attack. It is self-honesty.

There is a quiet strength in standing on what is verifiable and letting everything else fall away. You stop chasing certainty where none exists. You stop fighting battles that don’t matter. You become harder to manipulate, because you are not driven by belief-based fear or belief-based hope.

I am not here to tell anyone what to believe. I am here to say that belief is optional. Disbelief is optional. Reality is not.

You can meet life as it is, or you can meet it through layers of story, expectation, and belief. One of those approaches reduces friction. The other multiplies it.

Living in alignment with what’s so is not glamorous. It doesn’t promise transcendence or salvation. What it offers instead is clarity. And clarity, in the long run, beats comfort.

So this is what I stand for. I stand for knowledge over belief. Evidence over assertion. Reality over narrative. What’s so over what I wish were so.

I don’t need to believe in reality. I live in it. And that, for me, is enough.
