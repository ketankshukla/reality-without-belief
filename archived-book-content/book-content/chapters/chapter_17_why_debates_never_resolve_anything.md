# Chapter 17: Why Debates Never Resolve Anything

Watch any debate and you will see the same pattern repeat. Two sides present arguments. Each side becomes more convinced of their own position. The audience members who agreed with side A before the debate agree with side A afterward. The audience members who agreed with side B remain with side B. The uncommitted remain uncommitted or choose based on performance rather than substance. Nothing is resolved. No one changes their mind. The debate ends and the disagreement continues exactly as it was before.

This pattern is so consistent that it should prompt a question: if debates do not resolve disagreements, why do we have them? The answer is that debates serve functions other than resolution. They serve entertainment. They serve tribal signaling. They serve the emotional satisfaction of watching your side attack the other side. They serve the illusion that reasoning is happening when mostly what is happening is rhetoric. But resolution is rarely among the functions served.

The reason debates fail to resolve disagreements is that they are structured around the wrong goals. A debate is a competition. There is a winner and a loser. The participants are trying to defeat each other, not to discover truth together. This competitive framing changes everything about how the participants engage. They are not listening to understand. They are listening for weaknesses to exploit. They are not considering whether the other side might be right. They are constructing rebuttals. They are not trying to find common ground. They are trying to claim territory.

In this adversarial context, concession is defeat. Admitting the other side has a point is giving ground. Changing your position in response to a good argument is losing. The incentive structure actively punishes the behavior that would lead to resolution. A participant who genuinely updated their view based on opposing arguments would be seen as weak, as having lost the debate. So no one updates. Everyone defends. And the debate ends with both sides more entrenched than before.

The audience dynamics compound this problem. Debates typically have audiences, either in person or through media. These audiences have already chosen sides. They are watching to see their side win, not to learn something new. They cheer the points that support their position and dismiss the points that challenge it. This tribal dynamic reinforces the participants' behavior. The debaters know they are performing for an audience, and the audience rewards confident defense, not thoughtful reconsideration.

The format of debates also works against resolution. Debates are timed. Each side gets a fixed number of minutes. Complex issues are compressed into soundbites. There is no room for the patient, exploratory conversation that might actually lead somewhere. Everything must be punchy, quotable, defensible. Nuance is a liability. Qualification is weakness. The format selects for rhetorical skill rather than intellectual honesty.

Then there is the selection of participants. Debates typically feature people who are already committed to their positions. They are advocates, partisans, representatives of their side. They did not arrive at their positions through the debate process. They arrived with their positions pre-formed, often as part of their identity or profession. These are precisely the people least likely to change their minds, because changing their minds would mean becoming different people, abandoning the position they are known for holding.

The deeper problem is that debates assume disagreement can be resolved through argument alone. This assumption is often false. Many disagreements are not about facts or logic. They are about values, priorities, and identity. When two people disagree about abortion or capital punishment or economic policy, the disagreement is rarely about what the facts are. It is about what matters more, about how to weigh competing values, about what kind of society we want to live in. These are not questions that evidence can settle because they are not empirical questions.

When values conflict, no amount of argument will produce resolution. Each side can grant all the facts and still disagree about what should be done. The debate becomes an exercise in talking past each other, with each side making arguments that would be compelling if the other side shared their values, which the other side does not. This is why political debates are so frustrating to watch. The participants are not actually engaging with each other's positions. They are performing for their respective tribes.

Even when disagreements are genuinely empirical, debates are not a good mechanism for resolving them. Empirical questions are resolved through investigation, experimentation, and evidence, not through rhetoric. The fact that someone is a better debater does not make their position more likely to be true. A skilled rhetorician defending a false position can easily defeat a less skilled speaker defending a true one. This is why science does not settle disputes through debate. It settles them through data.

The feeling that debates are productive is an illusion. The back and forth, the energy, the apparent clash of ideas, all of this creates the sensation that something is being accomplished. But activity is not progress. The fact that people are talking does not mean understanding is increasing. In most debates, understanding does not increase. Positions are stated and restated. Attacks are launched and defended. But no one comes away knowing more than they knew before. The sensation of productivity masks the reality of stagnation.

What would actually resolve disagreements is very different from debate. It would involve genuine curiosity about the other side's position. It would involve asking questions to understand rather than to trap. It would involve steelmanning the opposing view, presenting it in its strongest form rather than attacking weak versions. It would involve acknowledging uncertainty rather than projecting confidence. It would involve the willingness to be changed by the conversation. These conditions are rarely present in debate. They are rarely present anywhere.

The person who recognizes the futility of debate does not stop engaging with ideas or with people who disagree. They simply stop expecting debate to be the mechanism of resolution. They might engage in conversation rather than debate, with curiosity rather than combativeness. They might seek out the strongest versions of opposing views rather than the weakest. They might focus on understanding rather than winning. They might accept that some disagreements will not be resolved and that continuing to debate them is a waste of time.

There is a particular kind of disagreement that is especially immune to debate: disagreements rooted in different fundamental assumptions. When two people have different axioms, different starting points, different basic commitments about how the world works or what matters, their arguments will proceed from different foundations and will never converge. Each side's arguments will be valid within their own framework and irrelevant within the other's. This is not a failure of logic. It is a structural feature of how reasoning from axioms works. If your axioms differ, your conclusions will differ, and no amount of debate will change this.

Recognizing this changes how you engage with disagreement. You stop expecting to argue people out of their axioms. You stop being frustrated when debate does not resolve differences that cannot be resolved through debate. You become more interested in understanding where disagreements actually lie, whether they are about facts, about values, about axioms, or about something else. This understanding does not produce resolution, but it produces clarity. And clarity, even without resolution, is valuable.

The addiction to debate is hard to break because debate feels good. The clash, the competition, the sense of defending something important, these are psychologically satisfying. Winning a debate, or feeling like you won, produces a rush of triumph. Even losing can feel meaningful, like you fought the good fight. This emotional reward keeps people coming back to a format that produces nothing useful. The satisfaction is real even if the resolution is not.

Breaking the addiction means recognizing what debate actually is and what it is not. It is theater. It is sport. It is tribal performance. It is not a mechanism for discovering truth or resolving disagreement. When you want truth, you investigate. When you want resolution, you collaborate. When you want to understand opposing views, you listen. Debate offers none of these things. It offers only the appearance of them, wrapped in the genuine satisfactions of competition. Recognizing this for what it is allows you to stop wasting time on a format that never delivers what it promises.
