A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT (MAN):
A strikingly handsome young white man in his late 20s, positioned in the lower-center of the image (his face centered around 65-75% down from the top). He is captured in a close-up portrait facing slightly to the left, his face large and dominant, filling the lower-center portion of the frame. His expression is one of absolute calm in the face of the ultimate fact — death without belief, mortality faced with open eyes and without the comfort of reassuring stories. There is no fear in his face, no hope, no resignation — only the profound dignity of a man who looks at his own finitude and does not flinch, does not reach for a story, does not demand that the universe explain itself. His eyes are open, steady, luminous — looking at something vast and final with the same clear seeing he has practiced throughout the entire journey. His gaze is neither brave nor afraid — it is simply present. His lips are softly closed, the faintest line of acceptance — not acceptance as surrender, but acceptance as the ultimate act of engagement with what is so. His face is captured with hyper-real detail — natural skin with visible pores across his nose and cheeks, a well-groomed stubble along his strong jaw catching turquoise light, lines around his eyes that speak of a life fully lived and fully examined. His eyebrows are strong, completely relaxed, with individual hairs visible. His eyes are the deepest they have been in the entire series — large, striking steel-blue irises with turquoise striations radiating outward from the pupil, but the turquoise has deepened to a profound teal, as if the light within has matured into something permanent and unshakeable. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving his eyes a quality of serene, unflinching presence. His lashes are dark and naturally defined. He is remarkably handsome yet radiates something beyond handsomeness — the dignity of a human being who faces the end of himself without looking away. His skin is bathed in cool turquoise light from directly ahead, creating even, luminous highlights across his face. His short dark brown hair is natural, with subtle turquoise reflections.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
The man's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. His face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of his face, hair, or body may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — DEATH WITHOUT BELIEF:
Behind him and filling the upper two-thirds of the image, the background depicts the most powerful and most quiet visualization in the entire series. An enormous doorway stands at the center of the image — not ornate, not decorated, not symbolic. It is a simple, perfectly rectangular opening in the fabric of reality itself — its edges clean, its proportions elegant, its surface the thinnest possible boundary between what is and what is not. Through the doorway, pure turquoise light blazes — not harsh, not blinding, but deep, steady, infinite. This light is not heaven, not an afterlife, not a reward, not a promise — it is simply what is on the other side: reality continuing without the individual who stood in it. The turquoise light through the doorway has no features, no landscape, no figures — just light itself, honest and unnarrated. On this side of the doorway, the space is deep black — the lived reality of a finite existence, rich with shadows and substance. The boundary between the two — the doorframe itself — glows with the faintest turquoise outline, representing the thin line between being and not-being that every human will one day cross. The man stands on this side, facing the doorway, illuminated by its light — not walking toward it, not running from it, simply present with it. At the base of the doorway, turquoise particles drift across the threshold in both directions — life and death exchanging their substance in an endless, quiet transaction. The deep black background on this side provides dramatic contrast with the turquoise infinity beyond the door. Volumetric turquoise light streams through the doorway, casting long rays into the foreground.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

All text placement percentages below are measured from the TOP of the image and must be followed precisely to ensure uniform placement across all covers in the series.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, profound, cool turquoise tones blazing through an infinite doorway against deep darkness. The feeling of facing death without belief — not with courage (which implies fear overcome) but with the simple, dignified presence of a man who sees what is so and does not look away. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
