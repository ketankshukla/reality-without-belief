A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT (MAN AND WOMAN):
A strikingly handsome young white man in his late 20s and a breathtakingly beautiful young white woman in her 20s, positioned together in the lower-center of the image (their faces centered around 65-75% down from the top). They are facing each other in profile, their faces close together — perhaps six inches apart — looking directly into each other's eyes with an expression of genuine, unfiltered connection. This is not romance — this is two people who have learned to see each other without interpretation, without agenda, without the distortion of narrative. His expression is one of open, vulnerable attention — no performance, no attempt to impress, just the raw act of being fully present with another person. Her expression mirrors his — open, unguarded, fully receiving what she sees. Between their faces, the air seems to glow with a subtle turquoise luminescence — the visible manifestation of authentic connection, of two people engaging each other as they actually are rather than through the filters of belief and expectation. The man has a strong jaw with light stubble, short dark brown hair with subtle turquoise reflections, and deep green-gray eyes with turquoise striations — each detail visible even in profile. The woman has striking ice-blue eyes with turquoise striations, long dark brown hair flowing behind her. Both faces are captured with hyper-real detail — visible pores, natural imperfections, the subtle interplay of turquoise light and shadow across their features. Their skin is bathed in cool turquoise light from above, with additional warm light reflecting between their faces. Every micro-detail is rendered — the way his stubble catches light, the way her lashes cast tiny shadows, the glistening quality of their eyes as they truly see each other.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
Both faces must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Their faces occupy roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of their faces, hair, or bodies may enter the top 35% of the image.

BACKGROUND — GENUINE CONNECTION THROUGH CLEAR SEEING:
Behind them and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a powerful visualization of connection freed from distortion. In the upper two-thirds of the image, two enormous turquoise light beams emanate from opposite sides of the frame — one from the left, one from the right — representing two perceptions reaching toward each other. Where distorted perception would create chaotic interference patterns, these two beams meet cleanly at the exact center of the image — directly above the space between the man and woman's faces. At the meeting point, the two beams merge into a single, brilliant turquoise sphere of light — a luminous orb representing the point of genuine connection, where two people see the same reality without distortion. Around the sphere, geometric crystalline structures radiate outward — precise, symmetrical, beautiful — representing the extraordinary clarity that becomes possible when two people engage without interpretation. Surrounding this central phenomenon, the remains of old connection patterns are visible — tangled, knotted threads of gray and silver drifting outward and dissolving, representing the agenda-laden, narrative-distorted connections that most people mistake for authentic relationship. These old threads are dissolving into turquoise particles as the pure connection at the center grows stronger. The deep black background provides dramatic contrast. Volumetric turquoise light radiates from the central sphere. Tiny turquoise particles drift outward from the meeting point.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

All text placement percentages below are measured from the TOP of the image and must be followed precisely to ensure uniform placement across all covers in the series.

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "REALITY WITHOUT BELIEF" — small elegant Garamond font, centered horizontally, turquoise color (#00CED1), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 3: "THE PRACTICE OF"
Line 4: "CLEAR SEEING"

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 24% from top): An elegant turquoise ornamental filigree divider — a thin horizontal line that blooms into delicate curving scrollwork and flourishes at the center, with symmetrical ornamental curls tapering to fine points at each end. Rendered in turquoise (#00CED1) with subtle luminous glow.

Line 5 (exactly 26% from top): "How to See, Listen, Decide, and Respond Without Belief" — smaller italic Garamond, centered, light gray/cream color.

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 28% from top): An identical turquoise ornamental filigree divider matching the one above — same scrollwork, same flourishes, same symmetrical design.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Garamond font, centered, white/cream, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, intimate, cool turquoise tones against deep darkness. The feeling of two people connecting authentically — seeing each other clearly, without the distortions of belief, agenda, or narrative — and discovering that genuine connection is more powerful and more real than anything filtered communication could ever produce. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
