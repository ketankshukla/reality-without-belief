A stunning 9:16 portrait book cover rendered in ultra-high-resolution photorealistic style with cinematic color grading.

SUBJECT — CLOSE-UP PORTRAIT (WOMAN):
A breathtakingly beautiful young white woman in her 20s, positioned in the lower-right quadrant of the image (her face centered around 65-75% down from the top, offset slightly right of center). She is captured in a close-up three-quarter portrait, her face large and dominant, filling the lower-right portion of the frame. She is looking directly at the viewer with the most extraordinary eyes — wide open, penetrating, luminous — the eyes of someone who has developed the capacity to see without interpretation, to perceive what is actually there before the mind constructs a story about it. Her expression is one of profound, almost startling clarity — not cold, but intensely present, as if she sees through every layer of pretense and narrative directly to what is real. Her gaze is so clear it feels like being seen for the first time. Her face is perfectly still — no performance, no social mask, no attempt to communicate anything other than pure, undistorted perception. Her face is captured with hyper-real detail — flawless yet entirely natural skin with visible pores across her nose and cheeks, a scattering of faint freckles across the bridge of her nose, the faintest hint of peach fuzz along her jawline caught by the light. Her eyebrows are full, naturally shaped, relaxed and open, with individual hairs visible. Her eyes are the focal point of the entire image — large, striking ice-blue irises with turquoise striations radiating outward from the pupil like crystalline fractures, each striation a slightly different shade of teal and cerulean. The turquoise in her eyes seems to glow with internal light — as if clarity itself has become visible. Natural catchlights — two sharp, luminous reflections — sit in the upper portion of each iris, giving her eyes a deep, glistening, almost supernatural clarity. Her lashes are thick and dark, naturally fanned, each individually visible. Her lips are soft, naturally pink, relaxed and neutral — neither smiling nor frowning, simply present. She is stunningly gorgeous yet radiates an almost unsettling depth of perception — the beauty of someone who sees everything and judges nothing. Her skin is bathed in cool turquoise light from directly ahead, creating even, luminous highlights across her entire face. Her long dark brown hair frames her face naturally, individual strands catching turquoise light.

CRITICAL COMPOSITION RULE — FACE PLACEMENT:
The woman's face must be positioned entirely BELOW the subtitle text area and ABOVE the author name. Her face occupies roughly the 55%-82% vertical zone of the image. The top 45% of the image (where the title and subtitle text will be placed) must contain ONLY the background elements and open space — absolutely NO part of her face, hair, or body may enter the top 35% of the image. This ensures the title text zone is completely clear of the portrait.

BACKGROUND — SEEING WITHOUT INTERPRETATION:
Behind her and slightly out of focus, the background depicts a breathtaking visualization of perception being stripped of its interpretive layers. An enormous human eye — rendered in turquoise and teal tones, many times larger than life — fills the upper two-thirds of the image. But this eye is depicted in cross-section, revealing the layers of perception as architectural structures. The outermost layer is a thick shell of dark, opaque material etched with words — "interpretation," "judgment," "narrative," "assumption," "projection" — representing all the filters humans place over raw perception. This outer shell is cracking apart, enormous fragments falling away into the darkness, revealing the next layer beneath. The middle layer is translucent, shimmering with half-formed stories and faint images — the interpretive noise that distorts experience before it reaches awareness. This layer is also dissolving, becoming transparent. At the very center, the innermost layer blazes with pure turquoise light — the raw perception itself, undistorted, unnarrated, directly engaging reality. This core of pure seeing radiates turquoise light outward through the dissolving layers, illuminating the fragments of interpretation as they fall away. The deep black background provides dramatic contrast. Volumetric turquoise light streams from the pure perception core. Tiny turquoise particles and dissolving interpretation fragments drift throughout the scene.

TEXT — MUST BE RENDERED EXACTLY AS SPECIFIED WITH UNIFORM PLACEMENT. DO NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY:

All text placement percentages below are measured from the TOP of the image and must be followed precisely to ensure uniform placement across all covers in the series.

Line 1 (exactly 3% from top): "REALITY WITHOUT BELIEF" — small elegant Garamond font, centered horizontally, turquoise color (#00CED1), letter-spacing 0.15em, approximately 14pt equivalent.

Line 2 (exactly 6% from top): "BOOK IV" — Garamond font, centered, turquoise color (#00CED1), letter-spacing 0.2em, approximately 12pt equivalent. Flanked on the left and right by thin horizontal turquoise lines extending outward from the text.

Lines 3-4 (title block, exactly 10-22% from top): "THE PRACTICE OF CLEAR SEEING" — large, elegant Garamond font, centered, white/cream with subtle turquoise warmth. "THE" and "OF" are rendered noticeably smaller than "PRACTICE," "CLEAR," and "SEEING." "SEEING" is the largest word. Arranged as:
Line 3: "THE PRACTICE OF"
Line 4: "CLEAR SEEING"

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 24% from top): An elegant turquoise ornamental filigree divider — a thin horizontal line that blooms into delicate curving scrollwork and flourishes at the center, with symmetrical ornamental curls tapering to fine points at each end. Rendered in turquoise (#00CED1) with subtle luminous glow. This line appears ABOVE the subtitle.

Line 5 (exactly 26% from top): "How to See, Listen, Decide, and Respond Without Belief" — smaller italic Garamond, centered, light gray/cream color.

Decorative ornamental line (exactly 28% from top): An identical turquoise ornamental filigree divider matching the one above — same scrollwork, same flourishes, same symmetrical design. This line appears BELOW the subtitle.

Line 6 (exactly 92% from top): "KETAN SHUKLA" — large Garamond font, centered, white/cream, generous letter-spacing approximately 0.2em.

OVERALL MOOD: Cinematic, penetrating, cool turquoise tones against deep darkness. The feeling of layers of interpretation being stripped away to reveal the pure turquoise core of direct perception — seeing reality not through filters but as it actually is. Photorealistic, editorial quality, suitable for a bestselling non-fiction book cover.
