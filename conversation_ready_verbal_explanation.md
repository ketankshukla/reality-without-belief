# Short Verbal Explanation

> “I don’t really frame things in terms of belief or disbelief. I focus on what can be known, tested, or shown to make a difference. If a claim doesn’t affect understanding or action, I don’t argue about it — I just don’t use it.”

## If pressed further

> “It’s not that I’m undecided. It’s that belief itself isn’t necessary. Evidence and usefulness matter more to me than metaphysical certainty.”

## If someone says: “So you’re atheist?”

> “Not exactly. Atheism is still a position about belief. I’m more interested in whether the question itself adds anything.”

## If someone says: “You have to believe something”

> “I work with models and probabilities, not beliefs. They’re easier to update.”

## Exit line

> “If something can be shown to matter, I’m interested. If not, I’m comfortable leaving it open.”
