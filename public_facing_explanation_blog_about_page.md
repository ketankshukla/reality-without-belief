# A Position Beyond Belief

I don’t define my worldview by what I believe or disbelieve.

Instead, I focus on what can be known.

That means prioritizing evidence, logic, and real-world outcomes over faith, ideology, or metaphysical certainty. When a claim cannot be tested, demonstrated, or shown to improve understanding or decision-making, I don’t argue against it — I simply set it aside.

This approach isn’t about cynicism or skepticism for its own sake. It’s about clarity.

Beliefs often become identities. Once that happens, learning slows down. New information feels like a threat instead of an update. By removing belief as a requirement, ideas remain tools rather than commitments.

In practice, this means:
- valuing evidence over assertion
- outcomes over ideology
- understanding over certainty

It also means being comfortable with unanswered questions. Not every mystery needs a conclusion to be useful, and not every question deserves attention.

What matters is whether something helps us understand reality, reduce error, or act more effectively.

Everything else is optional.
