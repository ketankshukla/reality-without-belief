# Chapter 19: Science Misused as Identity

Science is a method. It is a way of investigating reality through observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and revision. It is a process for reducing error, for getting progressively less wrong about how things work. It is not a belief system. It is not an ideology. It is not a tribe. But for many people, science has become exactly these things. They have transformed a method of inquiry into an identity marker, and in doing so, they have corrupted what science actually is.

When science becomes identity, it stops functioning as science. The person who identifies as scientific, who belongs to the tribe of science, who defines themselves against the unscientific other, is no longer practicing science. They are practicing tribalism with scientific aesthetics. They defend scientific positions not because they have investigated them but because defending them signals membership. They attack opposing positions not because they have examined the evidence but because attacking them reinforces their identity.

This transformation is visible in how self-identified science advocates engage with claims. When a claim fits their tribe's positions, they accept it readily, often without examining the underlying research, its methodology, its replication status, or its limitations. The claim is scientific and they are scientific so they accept it. When a claim contradicts their tribe's positions, they reject it readily, again without examination. The claim is unscientific so it must be wrong. This is not the scientific method. This is tribal sorting wearing a lab coat.

The irony is severe. Science as a method is precisely the opposite of this tribal behavior. Science requires examining evidence regardless of whether it supports your current position. Science requires being willing to change your mind when evidence warrants. Science requires holding conclusions provisionally, always open to revision. Science requires humility about the limits of current knowledge. None of these requirements are compatible with identity fusion. When your identity is at stake, you cannot evaluate evidence impartially. When your tribe's position is threatened, you cannot update without social cost.

The tribalization of science has produced a strange phenomenon: people who loudly proclaim their commitment to science while violating its core principles. They mock those who believe without evidence while believing without evidence themselves, so long as the belief carries the label of science. They criticize closed-mindedness while being closed to anything that challenges their tribe's consensus. They demand evidence from others while accepting claims from their own side on authority alone.

This is not hypothetical. It is visible in public discourse constantly. Claims about nutrition, medicine, psychology, and climate are accepted or rejected based on tribal affiliation rather than examination. Studies are cited without being read. Methodologies are not evaluated. Replication failures are ignored when they affect favored conclusions. The scientific literature is used as a prop to support predetermined positions rather than as a source of genuine inquiry.

The person who has made science their identity is often worse at actual scientific thinking than someone with no particular attachment to science. The unattached person can evaluate claims without tribal pressure. They can change their mind without losing their sense of self. They can acknowledge uncertainty without threatening their membership in a community. The identity-attached person can do none of these things. Every claim is filtered through the question of what accepting or rejecting it would mean for their identity.

There is also the problem of science as authority rather than method. When science becomes identity, it tends to become authoritarian. The scientific consensus becomes dogma. Questioning it becomes heresy. Dissenters are not engaged but dismissed. This is precisely the opposite of how science is supposed to work. Scientific progress depends on questioning consensus. Every major advance in science came from someone who challenged what the scientific community believed. Treating current consensus as unquestionable truth freezes science into dogma.

The defense usually offered is that some positions are so well established that questioning them is unreasonable. Evolution, for example, or the basic physics of climate change. But notice the slide that happens here. From these well-established core claims, the identity of scientific extends to much less established claims, to preliminary findings, to contested interpretations, to positions that are scientific mainly in the sense that people who call themselves scientists hold them. The confidence appropriate to established findings is transferred to claims that have not earned it.

This inflation of confidence is particularly dangerous because it undermines trust in science. When self-identified science advocates oversell claims, when they present uncertain findings as settled, when they dismiss legitimate questions as anti-science, they create backlash. People who are skeptical of overconfident claims start to distrust science itself. The tribalization of science produces the very anti-science sentiment it claims to oppose.

The alternative is to relate to science as a method rather than as an identity. This means actually practicing the method: examining evidence, considering alternatives, holding conclusions provisionally, updating when evidence warrants. It means acknowledging uncertainty where uncertainty exists. It means distinguishing between what is well established and what is preliminary. It means being willing to say that you do not know when you do not know.

This relationship with science is less satisfying than the tribal version. You do not get the warm sense of belonging. You do not get the clear division between us and them. You do not get the confidence that comes from knowing your tribe is right. You have to live with uncertainty, with the uncomfortable acknowledgment that current scientific understanding is provisional and will likely be revised. This is harder. It is also more honest.

The tribal version of science is particularly appealing in polarized times. When society is divided into camps, science becomes another team jersey. You wear it to signal which side you are on. It stops being about understanding reality and becomes about winning arguments against the other side. The other side does the same with their own authorities and credentials. The result is that science, which should be a shared method for settling disagreements, becomes another weapon in tribal combat.

The person who uses science as identity often does not realize what they are doing. They believe they are championing reason against irrationality. They believe they are defending truth against delusion. They do not see that their own relationship to scientific claims is tribal rather than investigative. They do not see that they are as belief-driven as the people they criticize, just with different beliefs. This blindness is the signature of identity fusion. When you are inside it, you cannot see it.

Escaping this trap requires the same move we have seen throughout this book: separating beliefs from identity. You can value science, use scientific methods, accept well-supported scientific conclusions, all without making science part of who you are. You can hold scientific findings as provisional conclusions rather than as tribal commitments. You can update your views based on evidence without feeling that updating threatens your sense of self.

This separation allows you to actually practice science rather than just identifying with it. You can ask hard questions about claims, even claims that your tribe endorses. You can acknowledge when the evidence is weak or contested. You can change your mind when new evidence appears. You can say you do not know without feeling diminished. These are the capacities that science requires, and they are precisely the capacities that identity fusion destroys.

Science as method is one of humanity's greatest achievements. It has produced understanding that would have been impossible otherwise. It has enabled technologies that have transformed human life. It has corrected errors that persisted for centuries. This achievement is degraded every time science is reduced to an identity marker, every time it is used for tribal signaling rather than genuine inquiry. The person who truly values science will resist this reduction. They will use science as a tool for understanding, not as a badge for belonging.

The difference between science as method and science as identity is the difference between doing and being. Doing science means engaging in a process of investigation, testing, and revision. Being scientific means adopting an identity that requires defending certain positions regardless of investigation. The first is productive. The second is tribal. The first leads to knowledge. The second leads to the same kind of entrenched conflict that science was supposed to help us escape.
