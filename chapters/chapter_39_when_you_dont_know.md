# Chapter 39: When You Don't Know

Not knowing is the most common state a human can be in, and also the most denied. At any moment, you do not know vastly more than you know. You do not know most of what is happening in the world right now. You do not know what will happen tomorrow. You do not know what other people are thinking or what they will do. You do not know whether your beliefs are correct or your predictions will come true. You do not know the consequences of your decisions until those consequences unfold. This not-knowing is the water you swim in, so pervasive that you rarely notice it.

The denial of not-knowing takes many forms. There is the pretense of knowledge, acting as if you know when you do not. There is the substitution of belief for knowledge, treating what you believe as if it were established fact. There is the confidence that substitutes for certainty, feeling sure when you have no grounds for sureness. There is the busy activity that obscures not-knowing, staying so occupied with doing that you never face how much you do not know. All of these are ways of avoiding the discomfort of acknowledged uncertainty.

When you genuinely face not-knowing, the experience is uncomfortable. There is a kind of groundlessness, a lack of the solid footing that knowledge provides. There is anxiety about what might happen, about whether your actions are correct, about whether you are on the right path. There is vulnerability in admitting that you do not know, especially in contexts where knowledge is expected or valued. These discomforts are real, and they explain why denial is so common.

But the discomfort of facing not-knowing is less costly than the consequences of denying it. When you pretend to know what you do not know, you make decisions without the caution that uncertainty warrants. You commit to positions that may be wrong without the flexibility to revise. You close down the inquiry that might lead to actually knowing. You build on foundations that may not hold. The denial of not-knowing is not just psychologically dishonest. It is practically dangerous.

When you do not know, the honest response is to say so. This is simple but not easy. Cultures often punish admissions of not-knowing. Leaders are expected to have answers. Experts are expected to be certain. Ordinary people are expected to have opinions on everything. Saying I do not know can feel like failure, like inadequacy, like exposure. But it is also the only honest response when you do not actually know.

Saying I do not know creates space that pretending to know does not. It creates space for inquiry, for learning, for discovering what might actually be the case. When you admit that you do not know, you can start trying to find out. When you pretend to know, you have closed that door. You have committed to a position and must defend it rather than investigate it.

There are different kinds of not-knowing. There is not knowing that could be resolved by investigation. You do not know the answer to a question, but you could look it up or figure it out. There is not knowing that cannot currently be resolved because the information is not available. The future is this kind of not-knowing. There is not knowing that cannot in principle be resolved because the question does not have an answer. Some metaphysical questions may be of this kind. Each type of not-knowing calls for a different response.

For not-knowing that could be resolved, the response is investigation. Do the work to find out. Look up the information. Run the experiment. Ask the person who knows. This is the productive response to resolvable uncertainty.

For not-knowing that cannot currently be resolved, the response is acceptance. You do not know what will happen tomorrow. No amount of investigation can fully resolve this. You can gather information, make predictions, prepare for possibilities, but you cannot actually know until tomorrow comes. Accepting this saves the energy that would be wasted pretending to know or worrying about not knowing.

For not-knowing that cannot in principle be resolved, the response is letting go. Some questions may simply not have answers. Some uncertainties may be permanent features of existence. Treating these as resolvable and spending energy trying to resolve them is futile. Recognizing that some things cannot be known and making peace with that is the appropriate response.

There is a relationship between not-knowing and the practices we have explored throughout this book. Seeing without interpretation involves acknowledging that you do not know the meaning of what you see until you have carefully examined it. Listening without agenda involves acknowledging that you do not know what the other person is saying until you have actually listened. Deciding without narrative involves acknowledging that you do not know why you choose what you choose. These practices all involve not-knowing in different dimensions.

Not-knowing is also the precondition for learning. If you already know, there is nothing to learn. Learning requires starting from a place of not-knowing and moving toward knowledge. The person who cannot tolerate not-knowing cannot learn because they cannot occupy the starting position that learning requires.

This connection between not-knowing and learning suggests a different relationship with uncertainty. Instead of experiencing not-knowing as inadequacy, you can experience it as opportunity. You do not know something, which means there is something to discover. You are uncertain about something, which means there is investigation to be done. Not-knowing becomes the beginning of a process rather than a state of failure.

There is also a kind of freedom in not-knowing. When you admit that you do not know, you are released from the burden of defending positions you cannot actually support. You are released from the performance of certainty when certainty is not available. You are released from the constant management of the gap between what you pretend to know and what you actually know. This release is a relief, even though it comes with the discomfort of acknowledged uncertainty.

Some people find that not-knowing becomes comfortable with practice. The discomfort of uncertainty diminishes as you spend more time in acknowledged not-knowing. You become used to holding questions open rather than forcing premature answers. You become comfortable saying you do not know without feeling that it diminishes you. This comfort is not the comfort of certainty. It is a different kind of comfort, the comfort of honest relationship with your actual state of knowledge.

Not-knowing includes not knowing about yourself. You do not know why you do many of the things you do. You do not know what you will want in the future. You do not know how you will react to situations that have not yet occurred. This self-not-knowing is particularly difficult because we like to believe that at least we know ourselves. Admitting that you do not fully know yourself is a deep form of humility.

When you do not know, there are things you can still do. You can act based on the best available information while acknowledging that it is incomplete. You can make decisions based on probability rather than certainty. You can prepare for multiple possibilities rather than assuming a single outcome. You can remain responsive to new information as it arrives. Not-knowing does not paralyze action. It shapes action to be more adaptive, more flexible, more responsive.

The world is full of people pretending to know things they do not know. They speak with confidence about the future, about complex systems, about the inner lives of others, about things that no one can actually know. This pretense is so common that it seems normal. But it is not honest. It is a collective performance of certainty that obscures the actual uncertainty in which we all live.

You can step out of this performance. You can admit not-knowing when you do not know. You can tolerate the discomfort and the social risk. You can model a different relationship with uncertainty for those around you. This stepping out is part of the larger project of living in reality rather than in a collective pretense about reality.

When you do not know, say so. When you cannot find out, accept that. When the question has no answer, let it go. When investigation is possible, investigate. When action is required despite not-knowing, act with awareness of your uncertainty. These are simple guidelines, but following them requires going against powerful forces: internal forces of discomfort with uncertainty, and external forces of social expectation for certainty. Going against these forces is difficult but it is also honest. And honesty with reality, including honesty about the limits of your knowledge, is what this book is about.
