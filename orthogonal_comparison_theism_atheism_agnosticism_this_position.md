# Position Comparison

## Theism
- Claim: God exists
- Nature: Positive belief
- Requirement: Faith or revelation
- Risk: Belief defended independent of evidence

---

## Atheism (Strong)
- Claim: God does not exist
- Nature: Counter-belief
- Requirement: Assertion beyond evidence
- Risk: Inverted dogma

---

## Atheism (Weak / Agnostic Atheism)
- Claim: No belief either way
- Nature: Suspended belief
- Requirement: Ongoing relevance of the question
- Risk: Endless debate over an unproductive claim

---

## Agnosticism
- Claim: The truth is unknown or unknowable
- Nature: Epistemic uncertainty
- Requirement: Continued engagement with the question
- Risk: Treating unknowability as a conclusion

---

## This Epistemic Position
- Claim: The question is irrelevant
- Nature: Exclusion, not opposition
- Requirement: None
- Advantage: No metaphysical commitments

---

## Key Difference

Other positions ask:
> “What should I believe?”

This position asks:
> “Does this question earn a place in my thinking at all?”

If it does not improve understanding or action, it is discarded.

---

## Summary
This position is not neutral.
It is selective.

It prioritizes knowledge, utility, and clarity — and leaves belief-based disputes behind.
