## ChatGPT / DALL-E Prompt

```
Create a photorealistic 1200×630 pixel Open Graph image for a philosophy book series website called "Reality Without Belief."

COMPOSITION:
A cinematic widescreen scene depicting a visual journey from left to right — from the darkness of blind belief to the freedom of clear seeing.

LEFT THIRD — THE PRISON OF BELIEF:
A dark, confined space resembling a crumbling stone room or institutional corridor. Faded theater masks — blank, expressionless, slightly cracked — float and dissolve in the air. The lighting is cold, blue-teal, with crystalline particles shattering outward. Fragments of stone walls with words like "Certainty," "Conviction," and "Faith" carved into them are crumbling and falling apart. The mood here is claustrophobic, unsettling, and collapsing.

CENTER — THE WOMAN:
A young woman with flowing brown hair stands at the center, facing slightly right. She is calm, composed, with a gentle expression of quiet clarity — eyes open, seeing directly. She wears simple, understated clothing (a light grey top). Behind her, the shattering masks and crystalline teal particles transition into warm golden light. She is the bridge between the two worlds. Her hair flows naturally in a gentle breeze.

RIGHT THIRD — THE FREEDOM OF REALITY:
An expansive, open landscape bathed in golden sunset light. A serene river or lake reflects the warm sky. A single large tree with a full canopy stands on a gentle hill. The sky opens to warm amber, peach, and soft gold tones. A silhouetted figure walks peacefully in the distance toward the horizon. The mood here is spacious, quiet, free, and profoundly peaceful.

CENTER OF THE IMAGE — THE SERIES LOGO:
A circular medallion — polished silver frame with a kintsugi pattern (gold veins running through cracked black obsidian). At the center, a hyper-realistic amber eye with a golden iris, looking directly at the viewer. Four clear diamond-cut gemstones are set at the cardinal points (top, bottom, left, right). This medallion is semi-transparent, overlaid at the woman's chest level.

BOTTOM — TEXT OVERLAY in elegant serif typography:
Line 1 (large, in cream/ivory with gold shadow): "Reality Without Belief"
Line 2 (smaller, in dark turquoise #00CED1): "A Five-Book Journey from Belief to Freedom"
Line 3 (small, in gold with transparency): "by Ketan Shukla"

OVERALL STYLE:
Photorealistic, cinematic, contemplative. The color palette is teal (#00CED1), deep black, warm gold, and amber. The transition from dark teal on the left to warm gold on the right is the defining visual motif. The mood is philosophical, powerful, and liberating. Volumetric lighting with the golden light from the right illuminating the woman's face. Subtle crystalline particles and light motes throughout. Premium non-fiction book marketing quality.
