I want to begin by saying this slowly and clearly, because it sets the tone for everything that follows. I do not live my life based on belief. I do not live it based on disbelief either. I find both unnecessary. What I rely on is knowledge, fact, evidence, and what can be verified, tested, or demonstrated. Beyond that, I align my life with what Werner Erhard calls “What’s So” — what actually is, not what I would like it to be, not what would make me feel better, and not what fits a preferred story.

Most people are raised to believe that belief itself is virtuous. Believe strongly enough and you’re considered grounded. Disbelieve strongly enough and you’re considered rational. But both of these are misunderstandings. Belief and disbelief are not indicators of truth. They are psychological positions taken toward claims. Truth exists independently of them.

Reality does not require belief to function. It does not improve when we approve of it. It does not weaken when we resist it. Gravity does not care whether you believe in it. Consequences do not wait for consensus. Facts remain facts regardless of how uncomfortable they may be.

Once this is fully seen, belief and disbelief start to look like distractions. They are ways of relating to ideas emotionally rather than dealing with reality directly. I am not interested in emotional relationships with claims. I am interested in what can be shown.

This is where “What’s So” becomes essential. What’s so is not philosophy and it is not mindset. It is ruthless honesty about the current state of reality. What has already happened. What is happening now. What cannot be undone by preference, argument, or denial.

What’s so does not care about intentions. It does not care about excuses. It does not care about fairness. It does not care whether you feel ready. It simply is what it is. When you stop arguing with it, you gain access to clarity.

Most suffering does not come from what’s so. It comes from resisting what’s so. From insisting reality should be different before we are willing to engage with it. From clinging to beliefs about how things ought to be instead of responding to how they actually are.

When belief and disbelief fall away, something practical replaces them. Evidence. Observation. Willingness to say “I don’t know” until something can be demonstrated. That humility is not weakness. It is discipline.

I am not against belief. I simply do not elevate it. I am not against disbelief. I simply do not treat it as superior. Neither deserves authority over action. Evidence does.

I ask simple questions. What is the claim? What supports it? Can it be tested? Can it be independently verified? Does it reliably predict outcomes? If yes, I take it seriously. If not, I leave it alone. I do not fight unprovable claims. I do not defend counterclaims. I conserve my energy for what matters.

Living in alignment with what’s so does not make you passive. It makes you effective. You stop wasting time wishing things were different and start dealing with where you actually are. From that place, intelligent action becomes possible.

This applies everywhere. Relationships. Work. Health. Failure. Success. Identity. When something ends, it ends. When something changes, it changes. Pretending otherwise does not preserve it. It only delays adjustment.

This approach removes drama without removing responsibility. You still act. You still choose. You simply do so based on reality rather than narrative.

Belief often turns into identity. Once that happens, evidence becomes threatening. Disbelief can do the same. I refuse both traps. I choose clarity over comfort.

I do not need belief to give my life meaning. Meaning is created through action, responsibility, and engagement with reality. I do not need metaphysical guarantees to live honestly.

When belief conflicts with evidence, belief loses. When disbelief conflicts with evidence, disbelief loses. Evidence does not negotiate.

This is what I stand for. Knowledge over belief. Evidence over assertion. Reality over narrative. What’s so over what I wish were so. I don’t need to believe in reality. I live in it.
