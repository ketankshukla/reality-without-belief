## Tips for Getting the Best Results

- **Be extremely specific in your prompts.** Include lighting direction, camera angle, lens type, color palette, and mood.
- **Use negative prompts** to exclude unwanted elements (e.g., "no text, no watermark, no distortion").
- **Generate at highest resolution available** — book covers need high-resolution images (at least 2400x4200 pixels for print).
- **Always specify aspect ratio** — use 9:16 for book covers.
- **For human subjects,** specify ethnicity, age, expression, and clothing in detail for consistent results.
- **Run multiple generations** — even the best tools need several attempts. Plan on generating 20-50 images to find 1-2 exceptional ones.
- **Post-process every image** — even the best AI images benefit from color correction, sharpening, and professional text overlay.

## Tools to Avoid for Book Covers

- **ChatGPT/DALL-E 3:** Produces stylized, illustrative images rather than photorealistic ones. Not ideal for the realistic, compelling look needed for these book covers.
- **Free online generators with watermarks:** Unprofessional results that won't meet book cover standards.
- **Tools without commercial usage rights:** Always verify that the tool's license allows commercial use for book covers.
