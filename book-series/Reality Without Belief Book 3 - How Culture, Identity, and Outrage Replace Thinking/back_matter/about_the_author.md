# About the Author

**Ketan Shukla** is the author of the *Reality Without Belief* series, the *Repetition: Mother of Mastery* series, and the *Aztec Samurai Adventures* fiction series. He writes about reality, mastery, and the stubborn refusal to accept comfortable stories when direct seeing is available.

He lives with his wife Nimisha and believes that the best non-fiction changes how you think, and the best fiction changes how you feel — and that both require the same commitment: say something true, and say it well.
