# Chapter 37 Summary: Letting Reality Correct You

## Core Argument
Reality constantly provides feedback about the accuracy of your understanding. The only question is whether you receive it — allowing reality to correct your errors — or filter and dismiss it to maintain existing views. This question determines, more than almost anything else, how effective your life becomes.

## Key Points

- **Most people resist correction.** They experience contradicting evidence as attack rather than information. They rationalize unexpected outcomes rather than updating expectations. Being wrong feels bad. Changing your mind feels like defeat.

- **Every error discovered is an error that can be fixed.** Every failed expectation is a map that can be updated. The discovery of wrongness is an advance, not a retreat. Reframing correction as progress transforms your relationship with learning.

- **Defending against reality is costly and compounds over time.** Each uncorrected error influences further beliefs, the gap between understanding and reality widens, and actions produce increasingly unexpected results — until reality forces a far more painful correction.

- **The practice has three components:**
  1. **Notice feedback** — outcomes not matching predictions, people responding differently than anticipated
  2. **Take it seriously** — don't dismiss as a fluke or exception
  3. **Actually update** — the hardest part, requiring admitting you were wrong and changing something

- **Stability vs. rigidity:** A stable person holds positions firmly while remaining open to correction — positions are firm because supported by evidence, not defended against it. Rigidity is groundedness in ego. Stability is groundedness in reality.

- **Not all feedback is valid.** Discernment about which corrections are warranted is itself a skill — and even that discernment is subject to reality's further correction.

- **Reality will correct you whether you cooperate or not.** The only question is how much suffering accompanies the correction. The defended person fights it. The open person integrates it. Same correction — two entirely different experiences.

## One-Line Takeaway
Let reality show you where you are wrong, welcome the showing, and use it to become less wrong — this simple practice asks only that you value accuracy more than being right.
