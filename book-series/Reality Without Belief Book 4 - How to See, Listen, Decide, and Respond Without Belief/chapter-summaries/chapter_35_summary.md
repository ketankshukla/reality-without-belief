# Chapter 35 Summary: Deciding Without Narrative

## Core Argument
Every decision comes wrapped in a story — but the narrative is often constructed after the decision, not before. The decision is made first, below conscious awareness, and the justifying story follows. Learning to decide without the narrative layer gives you speed, flexibility, and honesty that the narrative-dependent person never achieves.

## Key Points

- **The causation often runs backward.** We believe reasons precede decisions. But evidence shows people often decide before they can articulate reasons. The narrative is post-hoc construction, not the actual cause.

- **Narrative serves self-justification more than truth.** It makes decisions feel legitimate, protects from criticism, maintains your self-image as rational. But these functions come at significant cost: delay, distortion, and rigidity.

- **Deciding without narrative is faster.** You assess, consider, and choose. The choice is the output. No explanatory package required. This responsiveness is practically valuable.

- **This is NOT deciding without thought.** Thinking that informs a decision is different from the narrative that explains it. Thinking is processing. Narrative is storytelling. You can process without storytelling — and the processing, freed from creating a good story, produces better decisions.

- **Changing your mind becomes dramatically easier.** Decisions wrapped in elaborate justifications require dismantling the justification to change course. Without narrative, changing is simple: you chose one thing, now you choose another. No edifice to tear down.

- **Narratives enforce identity-consistent decisions.** You choose what "someone like you" would choose because decisions need to tell a coherent story about who you are. Dropping this requirement lets each decision be made fresh, based on current conditions.

- **The world doesn't require explanations for your decisions.** Reality doesn't ask for reasons. Consequences follow from actions regardless of the stories told about them.

## One-Line Takeaway
The narrative was never necessary — it was just habitual, and loosening that habit reveals a capacity for decision-making that is faster, more flexible, more honest, and more powerful.
