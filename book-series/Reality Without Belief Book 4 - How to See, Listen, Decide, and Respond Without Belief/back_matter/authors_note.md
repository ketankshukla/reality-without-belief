# Author's Note

Thank you for reading *The Practice of Clear Seeing*.

This is where understanding became a way of life. You can understand that belief distorts perception — but can you actually see clearly in the heat of the moment? That gap between understanding and practice is where most people stop. This book bridges it.

The chapters on letting reality correct you and handling being wrong were the most important to me. The willingness to be wrong — genuinely wrong, not performatively humble — is one of the rarest and most powerful capacities a human being can develop. Those three words — I was wrong — are not a defeat. They are an advance.

The final book — *The Quiet Exit* — faces the deepest costs and the deepest freedoms. Leaving belief communities. The loneliness of the path. Freedom without identity. Death without belief. And the quiet discovery of what remains when there is nothing left to defend.

With gratitude,
Ketan Shukla
