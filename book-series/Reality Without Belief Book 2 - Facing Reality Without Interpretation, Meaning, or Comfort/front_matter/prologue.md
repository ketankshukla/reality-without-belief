# Prologue

After the beliefs fell away, I expected emptiness. I expected the void that everyone warns about — the meaningless, purposeless vacuum that supposedly awaits those who abandon conviction. I braced for it.

It did not come.

What came instead was something I had not anticipated: the world itself. Not the world as I had believed it to be, dressed in stories about meaning and justice and purpose. The world as it actually is. Operating on causes and effects that care nothing for my preferences. Offering evidence that points where it points, not where I want it to point. Presenting itself without the comforting overlay of narrative that I had mistaken for reality itself.

This was disorienting at first. I had lived my entire life in an interpreted world. Every event had meaning. Every consequence carried a moral lesson. Every piece of evidence was filtered through what I already believed. When this interpretive machinery paused, what I saw was raw, unfiltered, and strangely alive.

I noticed that consequences simply followed from actions, without justice or injustice attached. I noticed that the evidence I had been ignoring was as real as the evidence I had been preferring. I noticed that truth and meaning were entirely different things, and that I had been treating them as one. I noticed that reality did not care about my existence, my opinions, or my suffering — and that this indifference, far from being terrifying, was oddly freeing.

These noticings became the foundation for a different way of engaging with the world. Not through belief, not through disbelief, but through accuracy. Through the discipline of seeing what is actually there rather than what I want to be there. Through the willingness to follow evidence rather than preference, to distinguish truth from meaning, to accept that the universe is indifferent without concluding that existence is pointless.

This book describes that foundation. It is not about what to believe. It is about what is so, and what it takes to see it clearly.
