# Chapter 12 Summary: Evidence Versus Preference

## Core Argument
There are two ways to arrive at a belief: following evidence wherever it leads, or starting with what you prefer and seeking confirmation. Most people do the second while believing they do the first. The person who can genuinely tell the difference gains an advantage that transforms every dimension of their life.

## Key Points

- **Evidence is information about reality independent of your wishes.** It is measurable, observable, and available to anyone. Preference is what you want to be true — shaped by desires, fears, identity, and group membership.

- **Motivated reasoning is documented, pervasive, and invisible from the inside.** When evidence supports preference, weak evidence is accepted uncritically. When evidence contradicts preference, strong evidence is scrutinized until dismissed. You genuinely believe you are being objective when you are not.

- **At the individual level, preference-driven thinking leads to persistent error.** Decisions based on inaccurate models produce poor outcomes, which are explained away rather than learned from.

- **At the social level, preference creates shared delusions.** Groups reinforce each other's motivated reasoning and collectively dismiss inconvenient evidence.

- **Three powerful practices counter preference-driven thinking:**
  1. **Actively seek disconfirmation** — Before accepting an appealing conclusion, look for evidence against it
  2. **Outsider perspective-taking** — How would someone without your preferences evaluate the same evidence?
  3. **Update openly** — When you change your mind, acknowledge it explicitly, making revision something to be proud of

- **The deepest challenge is emotional.** Evidence that contradicts preference challenges security, self-image, and social belonging. Following evidence over preference is a form of courage essential for genuine understanding.

## One-Line Takeaway
The person who develops the discipline of choosing evidence over preference — consistently, not perfectly — gains beliefs that track reality rather than desire, and that is the foundation of genuine knowledge and effective action.
