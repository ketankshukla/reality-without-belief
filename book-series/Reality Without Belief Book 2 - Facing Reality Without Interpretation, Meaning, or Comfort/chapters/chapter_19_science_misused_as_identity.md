# Chapter 19: Science Misused as Identity

Science is a method — one of humanity's greatest achievements. It is a way of investigating reality through observation, hypothesis, experimentation, and revision. It is a process for reducing error, for getting progressively less wrong about how things work. It is not a belief system. It is not an ideology. It is not a tribe. But for many people, science has become exactly these things — and understanding how this happens, and why it matters, gives you an extraordinary advantage in your own thinking.

When science becomes identity, it stops functioning as science — and this insight is profoundly important. The person who identifies as "scientific," who belongs to the tribe of science, who defines themselves against the "unscientific" other, is no longer practicing science. They are practicing tribalism with scientific aesthetics. They defend positions not because they have investigated them but because defending them signals membership. They attack opposing positions not because they have examined the evidence but because attacking them reinforces their identity. The person who sees this pattern — in others and in themselves — gains something remarkable: the ability to actually use science as it was designed to be used.

This transformation is visible everywhere — and recognizing it sharpens your thinking immediately. When a claim fits their tribe's positions, science-identified people accept it readily, often without examining the underlying research, its methodology, its replication status, or its limitations. When a claim contradicts their tribe's positions, they reject it without examination. This is not the scientific method. This is tribal sorting wearing a lab coat. And the person who can distinguish between genuine scientific inquiry and tribal performance has a thinking advantage that is almost impossible to overstate.

The irony is powerful — and seeing it is deeply clarifying. Science as a method is precisely the opposite of tribal behavior. Science requires examining evidence regardless of whether it supports your current position. It requires willingness to change your mind when evidence warrants. It requires holding conclusions provisionally, always open to revision. It requires humility about the limits of current knowledge. None of these requirements are compatible with identity fusion. When your identity is at stake, you cannot evaluate evidence impartially. When your tribe's position is threatened, you cannot update without social cost. Understanding this is not anti-science — it is pro-science in the deepest possible way.

The tribalization of science has produced a strange phenomenon — and recognizing it gives you clarity that most people lack. People loudly proclaim their commitment to science while violating its core principles. They mock those who accept claims without evidence while doing the same thing themselves, so long as the claim carries the label of science. They criticize closed-mindedness while being closed to anything that challenges their tribe's consensus. They demand evidence from others while accepting claims from their own side on authority alone. Seeing this pattern does not make you anti-science — it makes you genuinely scientific, because genuine science requires exactly this kind of honest self-examination.

The person who has made science their identity is often less effective at actual scientific thinking than someone with no particular attachment to science — and this insight is practically important. The unattached person can evaluate claims without tribal pressure. They can change their mind without losing their sense of self. They can acknowledge uncertainty without threatening their membership in a community. The identity-attached person can do none of these things. Every claim is filtered through what accepting or rejecting it would mean for their identity. The person who relates to science as a method rather than as an identity has access to a quality of thinking that the identity-attached person simply cannot reach.

There is also the crucial problem of science as authority rather than method — and understanding this protects you from a common trap. When science becomes identity, it tends to become authoritarian. Scientific consensus becomes dogma. Questioning it becomes heresy. But scientific progress depends on questioning consensus — every major advance in science came from someone who challenged what the scientific community believed. Treating current consensus as unquestionable truth freezes science into dogma. The person who genuinely values science will maintain the right to question — respectfully, with evidence, but genuinely — because that questioning is the engine of scientific progress.

The defense usually offered is that some positions are so well established that questioning them is unreasonable. But notice the slide that happens: from well-established core findings, the confidence extends to much less established claims — preliminary findings, contested interpretations, positions that are "scientific" mainly in the sense that scientists hold them. The confidence appropriate to established findings is transferred to claims that have not earned it. Seeing this inflation of confidence — and calibrating your own confidence appropriately — is one of the most valuable thinking skills you can develop.

This inflation of confidence is particularly dangerous because it undermines trust in the scientific enterprise itself. When science advocates oversell claims, present uncertain findings as settled, or dismiss legitimate questions as "anti-science," they create backlash. People who are skeptical of overconfident claims start to distrust science itself. The tribalization of science produces the very anti-science sentiment it claims to oppose. The person who presents science honestly — including its uncertainties and limitations — actually does more for public trust in science than any amount of tribal cheerleading.

The alternative is to relate to science as a method rather than as an identity — and this relationship is far more powerful. It means actually practicing the method: examining evidence, considering alternatives, holding conclusions provisionally, updating when evidence warrants. It means acknowledging uncertainty where uncertainty exists. It means distinguishing between what is well established and what is preliminary. It means being willing to say "I don't know" when you don't know. This relationship with science does not provide the warm sense of tribal belonging — but it provides something far more valuable: beliefs that actually track reality.

The tribal version of science is particularly appealing in polarized times — and understanding this helps you resist its pull. When society is divided into camps, science becomes another team jersey. It stops being about understanding reality and becomes about winning arguments. The result is that science — which should be a shared method for settling disagreements — becomes another weapon in tribal combat. The person who refuses to use science as a tribal weapon, who insists on using it as a genuine method of inquiry, is doing something rare and valuable.

Escaping this trap requires the same powerful move we have practiced throughout this series: separating beliefs from identity. You can value science, use scientific methods, accept well-supported scientific conclusions — all without making science part of who you are. You can hold scientific findings as provisional conclusions rather than as tribal commitments. You can update your views based on evidence without feeling that updating threatens your sense of self. This separation allows you to actually practice science rather than just identifying with it — and the difference in thinking quality is extraordinary.

Science as method is one of the most powerful tools available to human beings. It has produced understanding that would have been impossible otherwise. It has corrected errors that persisted for centuries. This achievement is degraded every time science is reduced to an identity marker, every time it is used for tribal signaling rather than genuine inquiry. The person who truly values science will resist this reduction — will use science as a tool for understanding rather than as a badge for belonging.

The difference between science as method and science as identity is the difference between doing and being — and this distinction matters enormously. Doing science means engaging in a process of investigation, testing, and revision. Being "scientific" means adopting an identity that requires defending certain positions regardless of investigation. The first is productive. The second is tribal. The first leads to genuine knowledge. The second leads to the same kind of entrenched conflict that science was supposed to help us transcend. Choose the method. Release the identity. And discover that science, practiced genuinely, is even more powerful than science performed tribally — because genuine science actually connects you with reality.
