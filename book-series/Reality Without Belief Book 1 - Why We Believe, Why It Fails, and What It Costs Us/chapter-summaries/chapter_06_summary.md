# Chapter 6 Summary: Why Humans Prefer Stories Over Reality

## Core Argument
Reality is not a story — it has no plot, no protagonist, no satisfying arc. But your brain imposes narrative on everything, and when narrative conflicts with reality, narrative almost always wins. Seeing this gives you access to reality itself, unfiltered by the stories you have been unconsciously layering on top of it.

## Key Points

- **The brain evolved to process information in narrative form.** Stories are our native format — how we remember, make sense, transmit knowledge. But the world comes in data format, not story format. Forcing data into story distorts it — and the distortion feels like understanding.

- **Narrative imposition happens automatically.** Something good happens, then something bad — your mind immediately constructs a connection. The events may be entirely independent, but the mind cannot tolerate randomness. Finding a story feels like understanding even when no understanding has occurred.

- **Stories create four specific distortions:**
  1. **Stories are selective** — They include what fits and exclude what does not, becoming filters that distort perception
  2. **Stories are linear** — They impose clean cause-and-effect on multivariate, complex reality with feedback loops
  3. **Stories have meanings** — Reality does not have built-in meanings. Imposed meaning feels like discovery rather than invention
  4. **Stories have endings** — Reality does not. Expecting closure that never arrives creates perpetual frustration

- **Religious stories, political ideologies, and personal life narratives all operate the same way.** They are narrative structures that organize reality into meaningful patterns. People adopt them because the story resonates — it feels true because it feels like a good story should feel.

- **Stories explain why people resist updating beliefs.** In a story, you do not revise earlier chapters. Treating beliefs as story makes them feel already written. New information that requires revision is resisted because it threatens narrative coherence.

- **The alternative is not meaninglessness — it is engaging with reality on its own terms.** Recognizing that events often have no inherent meaning is not a loss but a liberation. Patterns discovered through careful observation are fundamentally different from patterns imposed through narrative construction.

- **The most important stories to recognize are the ones you do not currently recognize as stories** — the ones absorbed in childhood, repeated so often they feel like facts, forming the invisible architecture of your worldview.

## One-Line Takeaway
Stories are powerful tools — use them to communicate and motivate, but never mistake them for reality. What remains when story is stripped away is more solid, more real, and more extraordinary than any narrative.
