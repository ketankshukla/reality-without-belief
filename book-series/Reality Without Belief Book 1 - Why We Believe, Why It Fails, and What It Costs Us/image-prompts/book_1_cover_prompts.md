## Prompt 1: The Shattered Belief Mask

A stunning young white woman in her early 20s, standing confidently facing the camera with an expression of profound breakthrough and liberation. She is holding a cracked porcelain mask away from her face — the mask represents the false face of belief. The mask has words etched into it like "certainty," "conviction," "faith" that are cracking apart. Behind her, the background transitions from a dark, foggy, oppressive atmosphere on the left to brilliant warm golden light on the right, symbolizing the journey from blind belief to clarity. She wears a clean white blouse, her hair flowing naturally. Her eyes are bright and alive with the look of someone who has just seen truth for the first time. Photorealistic, cinematic lighting, high contrast. Cover dimensions: 2700 x 4800 pixels (9:16 portrait). Text layout from top to bottom — Title: "REALITY WITHOUT BELIEF" in uppercase Garamond Bold, approximately 180pt, centered horizontally, positioned 8% from the top edge, white or warm cream color with subtle drop shadow for legibility. Book number: "BOOK I" in uppercase Garamond Regular, approximately 90pt, centered horizontally, positioned 14% from the top edge, with wide letter spacing (tracking 200), same color as title. Subtitle: "Why We Believe, Why It Fails, and What It Costs Us" in Garamond Italic, approximately 64pt, centered horizontally, positioned 19% from the top edge, same color as title. Author name: "KETAN SHUKLA" in uppercase Garamond Bold, approximately 120pt, centered horizontally, positioned 90% from the top edge (near the bottom), with generous letter spacing (tracking 250), same color as title. All text must be clearly legible against the background image.

## Prompt 2: Breaking the Chain of Certainty

A powerful close-up of a beautiful young white woman in her 20s, photographed from slightly below, giving her a heroic and empowered presence. Her hands are raised in front of her, and between them a glowing golden chain is snapping apart — each link of the chain is labeled with words like "belief," "certainty," "conviction," "identity." The broken chain fragments dissolve into particles of light. Her expression is fierce determination mixed with joy — the look of someone who has freed themselves from invisible constraints. Background is a deep midnight blue gradient fading to warm amber at the horizon line. Photorealistic, dramatic studio lighting with rim light. Cover dimensions: 2700 x 4800 pixels (9:16 portrait). Text layout from top to bottom — Title: "REALITY WITHOUT BELIEF" in uppercase Garamond Bold, approximately 180pt, centered horizontally, positioned 8% from the top edge, white or warm cream color with subtle drop shadow for legibility. Book number: "BOOK I" in uppercase Garamond Regular, approximately 90pt, centered horizontally, positioned 14% from the top edge, with wide letter spacing (tracking 200), same color as title. Subtitle: "Why We Believe, Why It Fails, and What It Costs Us" in Garamond Italic, approximately 64pt, centered horizontally, positioned 19% from the top edge, same color as title. Author name: "KETAN SHUKLA" in uppercase Garamond Bold, approximately 120pt, centered horizontally, positioned 90% from the top edge (near the bottom), with generous letter spacing (tracking 250), same color as title.

## Prompt 3: Eyes Wide Open

A breathtaking portrait of a young white woman in her early 20s with striking clear eyes, looking directly at the camera with an expression of absolute clarity and fearless awareness. One half of her face is subtly overlaid with transparent layers of text — fragments of beliefs, opinions, stories, narratives — that are peeling away and dissolving into the air like burning paper. The other half of her face is completely clear, luminous, and radiant. The background behind the belief-layered side is dark and cluttered. The background behind the clear side is a vast, open, sunlit sky. This visual directly represents seeing reality without the overlay of belief. Photorealistic, soft natural lighting. Cover dimensions: 2700 x 4800 pixels (9:16 portrait). Text layout from top to bottom — Title: "REALITY WITHOUT BELIEF" in uppercase Garamond Bold, approximately 180pt, centered horizontally, positioned 8% from the top edge, white or warm cream color with subtle drop shadow for legibility. Book number: "BOOK I" in uppercase Garamond Regular, approximately 90pt, centered horizontally, positioned 14% from the top edge, with wide letter spacing (tracking 200), same color as title. Subtitle: "Why We Believe, Why It Fails, and What It Costs Us" in Garamond Italic, approximately 64pt, centered horizontally, positioned 19% from the top edge, same color as title. Author name: "KETAN SHUKLA" in uppercase Garamond Bold, approximately 120pt, centered horizontally, positioned 90% from the top edge (near the bottom), with generous letter spacing (tracking 250), same color as title. All text must be clearly legible against the background image.

## Prompt 4: Stepping Beyond the Crowd

A wide shot showing a beautiful young white woman in her 20s stepping forward out of a crowd of people who are all looking down at glowing screens and devices, their faces lit by the blue glow, their expressions blank and conforming. She alone is looking up, her face illuminated by warm natural sunlight breaking through clouds above. She has an expression of inspired awakening — the look of someone who has broken free from the collective trance of belief. She is mid-stride, walking forward with purpose and confidence. The crowd behind her is slightly blurred and monochrome. She is in full color, vibrant, alive. Photorealistic, cinematic composition with dramatic natural lighting. Cover dimensions: 2700 x 4800 pixels (9:16 portrait). Text layout from top to bottom — Title: "REALITY WITHOUT BELIEF" in uppercase Garamond Bold, approximately 180pt, centered horizontally, positioned 8% from the top edge, white or warm cream color with subtle drop shadow for legibility. Book number: "BOOK I" in uppercase Garamond Regular, approximately 90pt, centered horizontally, positioned 14% from the top edge, with wide letter spacing (tracking 200), same color as title.

## Prompt 5: The Mirror of Truth

A striking composition showing a beautiful young white woman in her early 20s standing before a large ornate mirror. In the mirror, her reflection shows her surrounded by swirling, colorful, beautiful but illusory patterns — representing beliefs, stories, narratives, certainties — all the comfortable fictions. But the real woman standing in front of the mirror is in clean, clear, unadorned reality — simple, powerful, present. She has one hand touching the mirror surface, and where her fingers touch, the illusory patterns in the reflection crack and dissolve, revealing clear light behind them. Her expression is one of calm power and breakthrough — the face of someone choosing reality over beautiful illusion. Photorealistic, dramatic lighting with the mirror providing warm glow. Cover dimensions: 2700 x 4800 pixels (9:16 portrait). Text layout from top to bottom — Title: "REALITY WITHOUT BELIEF" in uppercase Garamond Bold, approximately 180pt, centered horizontally, positioned 8% from the top edge, white or warm cream color with subtle drop shadow for legibility. Book number: "BOOK I" in uppercase Garamond Regular, approximately 90pt, centered horizontally, positioned 14% from the top edge, with wide letter spacing (tracking 200), same color as title. Subtitle: "Why We Believe, Why It Fails, and What It Costs Us" in Garamond Italic, approximately 64pt, centered horizontally, positioned 19% from the top edge, same color as title.
