# Chapter 48 Summary: Legacy Without Myth

## Core Argument
The desire to leave a legacy is how humans manage the fear of death — a form of secular immortality built on myth. The person who sees through this myth and releases the drive for legacy discovers a quality of action and living that the legacy-seeker never reaches.

## Key Points

- **The myth of legacy doesn't survive examination:** What you leave behind is not you. Being remembered is not similar to being alive. Your impact after death won't matter to you when you don't exist. All legacies eventually fade.

- **The drive for legacy distorts life.** People sacrifice present joy for future recognition, make choices based on how they'll be remembered rather than what's right now, orient toward an imagined future they'll never see.

- **Legacy without myth means doing what you do for its own sake.** Create because creating is valuable now. Help because helping is good. Build because building is worthwhile. Not for future recognition — for present value.

- **Most people are not remembered for long.** A few generations, then forgotten. Even the famous are remembered as simplified myths. Recognizing this frees you from an enormous and unnecessary burden.

- **What you do matters NOW.** Impact is real and present. It doesn't need to extend into a future you won't see to be significant. Significance does not require permanence.

- **Action without concern for legacy is purer.** You can want positive effects that persist — but because they're good for those who experience them, not because they reflect on your memory.

- **Legacy thinking distorts values.** It makes big public achievements seem more important than small private ones. Releasing it allows you to value what's actually valuable.

## One-Line Takeaway
Reality guarantees only this moment, and then another, until there are no more — and that, when you can truly receive it, is more than enough.
