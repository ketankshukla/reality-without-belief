Chapter 46: Living Without Explanation

There is a deep human craving for explanation — and releasing this craving is one of the most freeing and practically powerful things you can do. When something happens, we want to know why. When we act, we want a story about what moved us. This craving runs so deep that we often create explanations where none exist — fabricating reasons, inventing causes, constructing narratives to fill the gap. And the person who can release this craving — who can live without requiring that everything explain itself — discovers a directness of engagement with reality that the explanation-seeker never reaches.

Living without explanation means accepting that things happen without always knowing why — and this acceptance is not weakness but extraordinary strength. It means acting without always having a story about what you are doing. It means encountering the world without requiring the world to justify itself to you. The craving for explanation is connected to the need for control — if you can explain something, you feel you can predict it, perhaps master it. But much of what happens is genuinely beyond your understanding. The person who can accept this — without fabricating false explanations to fill the gap — engages with reality far more effectively than the person who demands understanding before engagement.

Explanation often does not deliver what it promises — and seeing this clearly is deeply practical. Many explanations we construct are false: stories that feel right but do not correspond to actual causes. We explain others' behavior based on assumptions about motives that are often wrong. We explain our own actions based on reasons that may not be the real reasons. The explanations provide the feeling of understanding without the reality of understanding. When you live without explanation, you give up this false comfort — and what you gain is honesty. You acknowledge that you do not always know why things happen. You hold your explanations, when you offer them, as hypotheses rather than certainties.

Living without explanation does not mean abandoning inquiry — and this distinction is important. You can still ask why. You can still investigate causes. You can still seek understanding. The difference is in how you hold the results: provisionally when investigation produces answers, with acceptance when it produces none. You do not fabricate explanations where honest inquiry leaves not-knowing. And this honesty — this willingness to tolerate not-knowing rather than fill it with fabricated certainty — is one of the most valuable intellectual practices available.

There is a remarkable freedom in not needing to explain — and this freedom is immediately practical. When you do not require explanations, you encounter things more directly. The event happens. You experience it. You respond. The additional layer of explanation — which often distorts more than it clarifies — is not required. You are in more direct contact with what is so because you are not filtering it through explanatory frameworks.

This is especially true for self-explanation — and releasing it is profoundly liberating. Most people carry a constant internal narrative explaining themselves to themselves: why they did what they did, what they are feeling and why, how current behavior fits their story. This internal explanation is exhausting and often inaccurate. Living without explanation includes living without this constant self-narration. You act. You feel. You do not need to explain it to yourself. And the mental quietness that results is genuinely remarkable.

The demand for explanation can also prevent action — and understanding this unlocks capability. Many actions arise from sources that cannot be articulated: intuition, subtle perception, body wisdom. The person who demands explanation before action is cut off from these sources. Living without explanation means being willing to act without fully understanding why — trusting that effective action does not always come with explanatory packaging. And the person who can trust this discovers that their capacity for action is far greater than they thought.

Others may demand explanations from you — and you do not owe explanations you do not have. You can respond with what you know while acknowledging what you do not. "I do not know why" is an honest and complete answer. The social expectation that you should be able to explain yourself is just that — an expectation. It is not a requirement of reality.

The craving for explanation also creates suffering — and understanding this is deeply important. When something painful happens, "why?" is often the loudest response. Why did this happen? Why to me? These questions, when they have no answers, become sources of additional suffering. You suffer from the event and from the inability to explain the event. Living without explanation means letting the second suffering go. The event happened. That is what is so. Explanation would not undo it.

There is a simplicity to living without explanation — and this simplicity is not simplistic but mature. Much of the complexity of mental life comes from the explanatory apparatus: the constant why, the endless search for reasons, the maintenance of explanatory frameworks. When this is set aside, life becomes simpler and more direct. Events happen. You respond. The energy that was consumed by explanation becomes available for engagement.

You can live without knowing why. You can act without being able to explain. You can experience without narrating. This is not a lesser way of living — in many ways it is more direct, more honest, more immediate. The explanations were never as solid as they seemed. Living without them is living closer to the truth of how things actually are: often inexplicable, usually more complex than any explanation captures, always exceeding the stories we tell about them. And the person who can live this way — directly, without the mediating layer of explanation — discovers an engagement with reality that is richer, more responsive, and more alive than anything the explanation-seeker ever experiences.
